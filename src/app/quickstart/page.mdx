# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Tollbit API. We'll cover how to get your account ready and get started using one of
our API clients and how to make your first API request.

<Note>
  Before getting started, please create a Developer Account through the
  [Developer Dashboard](https://hack.tollbit.com)
</Note>

## Register your AgentID

Once you've created an account on the [Developer Dashboard](https://hack.tollbit.com), head to the [Dashboard > Home](https://hack.tollbit.com/home) page. There, you can
register your unique [AgentID](/dev-overview#agentid). Think of this as your username as you make requests to content providers on Tollbit.

## Copy your secret key

Next, head to the [Dashboard > Access](https://hack.tollbit.com/access) page and copy your secret key. DO NOT share this with anyone. Keep it safe!

## Choose your client

To the code! Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use.
In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Tollbit offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP.
In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install the Protocol JavaScript SDK
npm install @example/protocol-api --save
```

```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
# Install the Protocol Python SDK
pip install protocol_api
```

```bash {{ language: 'go' }}
# Install the Protocol Python SDK
go download tollbit
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/sdks" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Check out our list of first-party SDKs</>
  </Button>
</div>

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Tollbit API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
```

```js
import ApiClient from '@example/protocol-api'

const client = new ApiClient(token)

await client.conversations.list()
```

```python
from protocol_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.conversations.list()
```

```php
$client = new \Protocol\ApiClient($token);

$client->conversations->list();
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/conversations" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint</>
  </Button>
</div>

## What's next?
