# Developer Dashboard Overview

A full overview of the pages and main ideas presented in the [Developer Dashboard](https://hack.tollbit.com).

## The Home page

The home page is where you can get up to date summaries of your usage. You can also register your applications' AgentIDs.

## AgentIDs

AgentIDs are unique "usernames" for your AI applications. They are meant to self-identify your AI agents. The idea behind an AgentID
is directly built on top of the HTTP header [User Agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent), where
the AgentID is the "name" field of the UA String.

    ```json {{ title: 'Example User Agent with AgentID' }}

    Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko); compatible; TOLLBIT/1.0; +https://tollbit.com/bot

    ```

This is an example full User Agent string with AgentID of `TOLLBIT`.

## Access

symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) key algorithms.
