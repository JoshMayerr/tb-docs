# Dashboard

Your dashboard is your control center in monitizing your content.

## Adding your Property

When you first log in, you will be taken to the property overview page. This is where you will be able to view all the properties under
your organization and add new ones. Adding a new property is as simple as clicking on `Create Property` and adding your property's domain.
Once you've added your property, we will automatically fetch your sitemap through your `robots.txt` to determine your site's layout.

<Note>
  Much of our functionality relies on a well formatted `robots.txt` file and a
  sitemap that is kept up to date.
</Note>

## Verifying your Domain and Setting up your Subdomain

After adding your property, the next step is to verify your domain and set up your subdomain. You want to set up your `tollbit` subdomain so that
users can easily access the content mirrored on your main website. This will not affect your main website's SEO, load times, etc.
Navigate to your DNS provider and create a new A record for your domain. If your main website were `www.example.com`, the subdomain should appear as `tollbit.example.com`.
Point this A record at the IP address `138.197.55.236`. Once you have done that, please email team@tollbit.com and we will add the finishing touches
on our end to fully route your subdomain to our platform.

At the same time that you are setting up your subdomain, you can easily verify your domain. Simply create a new TXT record for your new `tollbit` subdomain
and copy the domain verification code into it, making sure that there are no trailing spaces. To complete verification, navigate to the home page for your property
on your dashboard and click "Verify".

## Rates

This is the core of the Tollbit product, and where you can set prices on your content. At the moment there are a few ways to set rates. Please
do not hesitate to email us at team@tollbit.com if you have any suggestions for other ways to price your content! Rates currently have the following
heiarchy: `bot -> page -> keyword -> time -> directory`. This means that when determine the price of a page for a particular request,
we first check if that request is from a bot that matches any of your bot rates. If so, we return that rate. If there are no bot matches,
we then check if the requested page matches any of your page rates. We keep going down the chain, trying to find a match, and if we find no
matches at the end, the price is assumed to be 0.

### Bot Rates

These rates allow you to set special rates for any specific bots that access your platform, and will override all other rates.
You should set this type of rate if you have struck a licensing deal with a company that employs a particular user agent, and want to give
them special rates to access your content (usually 0).

### Page Rates

These rates allow you to set a rate for a specific page on your website. If you have any page that you know gets high bot traffic (i.e. sports or election results),
or if you have a very high quality piece of original reporting, you can set a special rate for that page. This will override all other rates except
bot rates.

### Keyword Rates

These rates allow you to set a price for pages that may contain a particular keyword. If you know that there are some high profile sporting
events coming up, you may want to set a higher price for pages that mention `football` or `basketball`. This rate is still in beta.

### Time Rates

This rate allows you to define how the price of a page should change over time. You set a starting price for just published or updated content, and
can define what the price of the content should be after a set amount of time passes from the last modified time. This rate allows you to
automatically price content without needing to constantly manage the dashboard.

<Note>
  Time Rates depend on your sitemap using the `lastmod` XML tags. This is how we
  know when a page has been last modified.
</Note>

### Directory Rates

These rates let you set a flat fee for all the content within a page directory of your site. For a quick way to instantly price your content,
you can set a price for your top level directory, and this will automatically apply to all pages. You can drill down into further subdirectories
and set pricing there, and it will override any price in a higher directory. For example, you can set a base price of $0.001 at the root
level, and then set a price of $0.005 for the `/sports` directory. Everything under `/sports` will now be $0.005 while something under `/cooking`
will still be $0.001.

## Transactions

This page provides an audit trail where you can see all the requests that have been made to your website through Tollbit. For each request,
you are able to see the user agent that made the request, the page they hit, and the price they paid for that page.

## Payment

In order to receive payment for the access to your content, you must add your payment information to your account. We parter with
[Stripe](https://stripe.com) to process payments. You will be able to add either your bank account or a debit card where we will deposit
payments to. Payouts will occur in the first couple days of the month, and will be for all transactions that took place in the previous month.
More specifically, this will be from `00:00:00.000 UTC` of the first day of the previous month, to `23:59:59.999 UTC` of the last day of the previous month.

<Note>
  Only admins in your organization will be able to view and modify payment
  information. Read the [Organization](publisher-org) section to see how to
  manage your org.
