## Why Tollbit? {{ anchor: false }}

Websites and complex UI are extra fluff in the emerging world of AI agents.
We envision an internet where our personal agents can freely
roam the internet, answering questions and acting on our behalf. They
don't care how buttons look, they want the underlying data presented on
the page.

Tollbit is aiming to power this application layer of AI. We provide
scalable and liscensed access to realtime data from primary sources
meant to perfectly integrate with your inference (or training) time data
uses like RAG. Stop paying and wasting time scraping. Use Tollbit to go
directly to the data instead.

## How it works {{ anchor: false }}

The _tollbit.example.com_ paradigm.

When using Tollbit, you have the Internet's data at your fingertips to build amazing AI applications. The key paradigm shift, is that
all participating content providers will create a tollbit.example.com subdomain. Instead of scraping the human facing site, you can directly
request tollbit.\<anywebsite\>.com/\<content-path\>, similarly as you have before. Except now, the response of that request is perfectly
formatted for RAG and liscensed for one time use because you went straight to the source, instead of through a shady scraping third party.
