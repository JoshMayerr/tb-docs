# A Tollbooth for your Content

Tollbit allows you to quickly set up a paid API in front of your website in as little as 15 minutes with no coding.
This effectively puts your data behind a paywall, and allows you to immediately start charging bots for on demand access.

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, contact team@tollbit.com to set up an account. Once you log in, you will immediately be able to start adding individual properties you own
and start settings rates on your content. For more information on how to do this, read on to our [Dashboard Overview](publisher-dashboard) section.
