# Logging

We provide a way for you to forward logs to our platform so that we can provide analytics on bot traffic and more.

## Fastly

Follow these steps to set up an integration into our platform if you use Fastly.

### Create a new Logging Configuration

Go to your [Fastly Dashboard](https://manage.fastly.com/configure) and pick the correct domain. Click
“Edit Configuration”, and clone your current configuration. This saves a new
configuration version as a draft, and allows you to rollback if necessary.
This should bring you to a new screen. On the sidebar, scroll down until you
see Logging and click on that. Then, click “Create Endpoint”.

### Configure your logs to be sent to our logging endpoint

Find the HTTP logging endpoint and click “Create endpoint”. You can set the name to anything descriptive (e.g. tollbit-prod).
Keep the placement option as the default selection. Make sure your log format is exactly as follows, without extra trailing spaces or newlines:

```
{ "timestamp": "%{strftime(\{"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"\}, time.start)}V",
"client_ip": "%{req.http.Fastly-Client-IP}V", "geo_country": "%
{client.geo.country_name}V", "geo_city": "%{client.geo.city}V",
"geo_postal_code":"%{client.geo.postal_code}V", "geo_latitude":"%
{client.geo.latitude}V", "geo_longitude":"%{client.geo.longitude}V", "host": "%
{if(req.http.Fastly-Orig-Host, req.http.Fastly-Orig-Host, req.http.Host)}V",
"url": "%{json.escape(req.url)}V", "request_method": "%{json.escape(req.method)}
V", "request_protocol": "%{json.escape(req.proto)}V", "request_referer": "%
{json.escape(req.http.referer)}V", "request_user_agent": "%
{json.escape(req.http.User-Agent)}V", "request_latency":"%{time.elapsed.usec}V",
"response_state": "%{json.escape(fastly_info.state)}V", "response_status": %
{std.itoa(resp.status)}V, "response_reason": %{if(resp.response,
"%22"+json.escape(resp.response)+"%22", "null")}V, "response_body_size": %
{resp.body_bytes_written}V, "fastly_server": "%{json.escape(server.identity)}V",
"fastly_is_edge": %{if(fastly.ff.visits_this_service == 0, "true", "false")}V }
```

Finally, set the URL to https://log.tollbit.com/log.

### Ensure that your Requests are Authenticated

Go into Advanced Options and set the “Custom header name” field to “TollbitKey”.
You must set the customer header value to your secret key. Log into your [TollBit portal](https://app.tollbit.com)
and go into the API key tab and copy your secret key. Paste it into the “Custom header value” field with no
trailing spaces. Keep all the other settings as default, scroll to the bottom, and save.

Once you are ready to publish these changes, click the “Activate” button. Keep in mind that if you have
other unpublished changes in Fastly, this may also publish those as well.
