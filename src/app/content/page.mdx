            until now, the internet has successfully
        differentiated humans and bots (at least enough to rely on).
            But in the age of AI this will not work.
        Captchas are easily bypassed, and eventuallyany user
            interaction on the internet will probably be
        navigable by an AI agent. Given this future, why
        continue to distinguish the two? What were to happen
        if you opened up theflood gates to bot mania? Imo,
        it might actually work to build a newer, more efficient
        layer of the internet where you dont have to actually
        navigate page to page. Instead alla human needs to
        do is ask for exactly what they want.When you think
        about what you do daily on the internet today you probalu
        think about scrolling on TikTok, X, or checking your
            email.Obviously, there are many concerns with such
        a drastic change to the internet.",
