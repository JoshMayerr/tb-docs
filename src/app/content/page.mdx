             until now, the internet has successfully
            differentiated humans and bots (at least enough to rely on).
             But in the age of AI this will not work.
            Captchas are easily bypassed, and eventuallyany user
             interaction on the internet will probably be
            navigable by an AI agent. Given this future, why
            continue to distinguish the two? What were to happen
            if you opened up theflood gates to bot mania? Imo,
            it might actually work to build a newer, more efficient
            layer of the internet where you dont have to actually
            navigate page to page. Instead alla human needs to
            do is ask for exactly what they want.When you think
            about what you do daily on the internet today you probalu
            think about scrolling on TikTok, X, or checking your
             email.Obviously, there are many concerns with such
            a drastic change to the internet.",
